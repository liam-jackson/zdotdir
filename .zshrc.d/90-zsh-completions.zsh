# To activate these completions, add the following to your .zshrc:

if type brew &>/dev/null; then
  FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-completions:$FPATH

  # autoload -Uz compinit
  # compinit
fi

# You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:

# rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit

# Additionally, if you receive "zsh compinit: insecure directories" warnings when attempting
# to load these completions, you may need to run these commands:
#
#   chmod go-w '/opt/homebrew/share'
#   chmod -R go-w '/opt/homebrew/share/zsh'
